Throughout the course, I have learned that a thorough approach to testing is crucial in ensuring that code is functional and that all business requirements are met. I have used different kinds of testing strategies to ensure that the programs created meets quality standards. I’ve used black box and white box testing and also focused on validating inputs against constraints using JUnit tests ensuring the functionality goals are met and secure handling of data.

I interpret user needs by looking into user requirements that are provided, by doing thorough research on topic taking into consideration maintenance and enhancement opportunities for the long run. I took the approach of setting up tests that reflect real-world scenarios, ensuring that the software's response to user inputs is as expected. This method allows me to confirm that user requirements are met for the program’s functionality. 

My approach to designing software is by adhering to best practices and ensuring proper test coverage. Writing proper Junit test cases that can check program output against the requirements is crucial when it comes to providing the end product that meets customer needs and desires.

Moving forward, I will be applying the techniques and strategies learned in this course to create robust and user-centric software. I also intend to keep refining my testing strategies to ensure user requirements are met and to keep the integrity of my code intact.
